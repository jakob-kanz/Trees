# Predicting Trees with a Random Forest

This is a project report about a machine learning model used to predict the species of trees in Vienna. I conducted this project to enhance the following skills:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Preprocessing for a machine learning model
  - Modelling for Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)
