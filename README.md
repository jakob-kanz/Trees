# Predicting Trees with a Random Forest

This is a project report on a machine learning model used to predict the species of trees in Vienna. I conducted this project to enhance the following skills using Python:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Data Preprocessing for a machine learning model
  - Modelling for Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)

You can find the project report in the file 'Trees Vienna ML.ipynb' above.
